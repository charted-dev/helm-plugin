# Security Policy

Our current security policy is due to change as [Noelware](https://noelware.org) is currently in early stages of opening up. In the future, we do plan to give out monetary rewards.

## How to report?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not create a public GitHub issue about potential high-risk security vulnerabilities!

**charted-server** has private security reporting on GitHub enabled, so you can submit it and the Noelware team will review it and get it patched as soon as possible.
