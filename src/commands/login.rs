/// Log into a **charted-server** registry.

/// The plugin uses a API key resource instead of basic authentication or
/// a session token so that it can live as long it requires to. An expiration
/// date can also be passed in via the `--expire-in` flag. If the plugin sees
/// the API key expires then it'll remove it from the `auth.yaml` file that
/// it founds the key from.
///
/// If the registry is Noelware's production server, then it'll use the login flow
/// system and will construct the API key when the flow is successful (this can be
/// disabled with `--no-login-flow`). Otherwise, it'll use the [`POST /users/login`]
/// endpoint if Basic authentication is disabled or just creates the API key with Basic
/// credentials.
