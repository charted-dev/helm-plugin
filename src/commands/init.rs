/// Initializes a new chart repository structure.
///
/// **helm charted** uses a `.charted.toml` file to define a list of
/// Helm charts that can be easily published to **charted-server**
/// using the following structure:
///
/// ```toml
/// repository."myuser/repo".source = "./charts/mychart"
/// ```
///
/// This is similar to the following JSON object:
/// ```json
/// {
///     "repository": {
///         "myuser/repo": {
///             "source": "./charts/mychart"
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will initialize a default `.charted.toml` configuration file. This will not
/// initialize any repositories as it is ambiguous to know the repository location (i.e,
/// the `myuser/repo` from above) since it needs to be known ahead-of-time.
